## 2025-05-15 - XSS via JSON-LD Script Injection
**Vulnerability:** Potential XSS via script termination in JSON-LD blocks.
**Learning:** Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject `JSON.stringify(data)` into a `<script>` tag is unsafe if `data` contains Notion-sourced content. An attacker could include `</script><script>alert(1)</script>` in a title or description, terminating the structured data block and executing arbitrary JS.
**Prevention:** Always escape the `<` character as `\u003c` after `JSON.stringify()` when injecting into a script tag.

## 2025-05-16 - URL and Proxy Hardening
**Vulnerability:** Protocol-relative URLs and embedded credentials in proxy destinations.
**Learning:** Functions like `sanitizeUrl` and `isTrustedImageHost` need to explicitly block protocol-relative URLs (`//attacker.com`) and URLs with embedded credentials (`https://user:pass@host`). While `new URL()` correctly parses these, simply checking `hostname` or `startsWith("/")` is insufficient to prevent all forms of obfuscation or unexpected redirects.
**Prevention:** Always verify `username` and `password` are empty in `URL` objects for proxy destinations, and ensure path-based sanitizers specifically exclude the `//` prefix.
