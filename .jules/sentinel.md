## 2025-05-15 - XSS via JSON-LD Script Injection
**Vulnerability:** Potential XSS via script termination in JSON-LD blocks.
**Learning:** Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject `JSON.stringify(data)` into a `<script>` tag is unsafe if `data` contains Notion-sourced content. An attacker could include `</script><script>alert(1)</script>` in a title or description, terminating the structured data block and executing arbitrary JS.
**Prevention:** Always escape the `<` character as `\u003c` after `JSON.stringify()` when injecting into a script tag.
